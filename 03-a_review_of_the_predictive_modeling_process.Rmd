# A Review of the Predictive Modeling Process

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos

### Cohort 1

00:11:35	Ben G:	Anyone know how to re-size an image for a Markdown slides presentation
00:19:03	Federica Gazzelloni:	ops sorry just seen it
00:20:15	Federica Gazzelloni:	anyway you can resize it using fig.dim=“some percentage” in the chunk
00:30:51	Ricardo Serrano:	Cohen's Kappa metric https://thedatascientist.com/performance-measures-cohens-kappa-statistic/
00:33:22	Federica Gazzelloni:	thanks @ricardo
00:37:32	Ricardo Serrano:	H2O Metrics Masterclass https://youtu.be/0bZeTUOPDTQ
00:37:47	Federica Gazzelloni:	{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.dim="50%"}
plot(pressure)
00:40:31	Jim Gruman:	roll_rs <- sliding_period(
  train_df,
  date,
  period = "month",
  every = 6L,
  lookback = Inf,
  skip = 2L
)

roll_rs |> 
  tidy() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Resample, 
             y = Row, 
             fill = Data)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_bw()
00:46:17	ethan tenison:	In the book it recommends doing 10-fold cross validation  plus 5 iterations for small datasets. Would bootstrapping still be better?
01:05:34	Jim Gruman:	thank you Ben!     I'm going to have to step away. See you all next week
