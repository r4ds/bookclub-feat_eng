# Engineering Numeric Predictors

**Learning objectives:**

-   Learn about common issues and techniques when handling continuous predictors
-   Feature Engineering techniques to:
    -   Address problematic characteristics of individual predictors

    -   Expand individual predictors to better represent complex relationships

    -   Consolidate redundant information

## SLIDE 1

-   ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
-   TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.
