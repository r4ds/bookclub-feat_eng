<p>The previous two sections focused on adjusting our features and creating new features from a single predictor, but we can also create new features from all of our predictors at once. This can correct issues like multicollinearity and outliers, while also reducing the dimensionality and speeding up computation times.</p>
<p>There are a ton of different techniques for this that are essentially broken down into four main parts: linear projections, autoencoders, Spatial sign, and Distance and Depth features.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1</span> Linear Projection Methods<a href="new-features-from-multiple-predictors.html#linear-projection-methods" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>More predictors is not always better! Especially if you have redundant information. This section is all about identifying meaningful projections of the original data. The unsupervised methods, like PCA, tend not to increase model performance, yet they do save computational time. Supervised approaches, like partial least squares, DO however if you have enough data to prevent overfitting.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1.1</span> Principal Component Analysis (PCA)<a href="new-features-from-multiple-predictors.html#principal-component-analysis-pca-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>PCA finds a linear combination of the original predictors that summarizes the maximum amount of variation. Since they are orthogonal, the predictor space is partitioned in a way that does not overlap. (uncorrelated)</p>

<p>We can see from the graph below that the first component USUALLY contains the most information. We can also see that some methods do much better than others.</p>

<p class="caption">Score values from several linear projection methods for the weekend ridership at Clark and Lake. The x-axis values are the scores for each method and the y-axis is ridership (in thousands).</p>
</div>
<p>Visualizing the principal components with a heat map can help us identify which predictors are impacting each component. The figure below visualizes the Chicago train dataset. We can see after the first component that lines are clustered together meaning the line probably has an effect on our outcome.</p>

<p>PCA is really effective when the predictors are linearly correlated, but what if the relationship is not actually linear but quadratic? That’s were kernel PCA comes in. There are MANY different kernels based on the shape of the predictor space (Polynomial, Gaussian etc), so you really need to inspect your data before setting kPCA up.</p>
<p>Because kPCA is more flexible, it can often lead to much better results. The firgure below shows how using basic PCA would actually lead to a poor fit.</p>

<p>PCA components are uncorrelated with each other, but they are often not independent.That’s where ICA comes in! ICA is similar to PCA except that it components are also as statistically independent as possible. Unlike PCA, there is no ordering in ICA.</p>
<p>Preprocessing is essential for ICA. Predictors must be centered and then <strong>“whitened”</strong>, which means that PCA is calculated BEFORE ICA, which seems rather odd.</p>

<p>PLS is supervised version of pca that guides dimension reduction optimally related to the response. Finds latent variables that have optimal covariance with the response. Because of this supervized approach, you generally need fewer components than PCA, BUT you risk overfitting.</p>

<p>Computationally complex multivariate method for finding representations of the predictor space, primarily used in deep learning. Generally they don’t have any actual interpretation but they have some strengths. Autoencoders are really good when there is a large amount of unlabled data.</p>
<p>Example: used in the pharmaceutical industry to estimate how good a drug might be based on its chemical structure. To simulate a drug discovery project just starting up, a random set of 50 data points were used as a training set and another random set of 25 were allocated to a test set. The remaining 4327 data points were treated as unlabeled data that do not have melting point data.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">6.3.1.7</span> Spatial Sign<a href="new-features-from-multiple-predictors.html#spatial-sign" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Spatial Sign is primarily used in image analysis, transforms the predictors based on their center to the distribution and projects them onto an nD sphere.</p>

<p><strong>THE EXAMPLE THEY GIVE INVOLVES CLASSIFYING IMAGES OF ANIMAL POOP!</strong></p>
<p>Spatial sign is really good at decreasing impact of outliers.</p>

<p>Distance and Depth Features take a semi-supervised approach for classification problems. Predictors are recomputed based on the distance to class centroid, sort of like knearest neighbor.</p>
