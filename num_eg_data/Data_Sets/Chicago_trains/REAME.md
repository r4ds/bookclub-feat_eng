These files are used to create the Chicago ridership data that are analyzed throughout the text. The data source was [City of Chicago web portal]( https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f) and was used to create `Entries.csv`. The two versions of the station information sources (`cta_L_stops_rls.csv` and `cta_L_stops_rls_2018.csv`) were also found at this site.  

The R packages need to run this code are `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `timeDate`, `recipes`, `caret`, `readxl`, and `retrosheet`.
